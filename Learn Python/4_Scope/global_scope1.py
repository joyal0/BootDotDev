"""Global Scope
So far we've been working in the global scope. That 
means that when we define a variable or a function, 
that name is accessible in every other place in our 
program, even within other functions.

For example:

	pi = 3.14
	
	def get_area_of_circle(radius):
	    return pi * radius * radius
Copy icon
Because pi was declared in the parent "global" scope, 
it is usable within the get_area_of_circle() function.


Assignment
Let's change how we are calculating our player's stats! 
The only thing we should need to define globally is the
 character level and then let our functions do the rest!

Declare the variable player_level at the top of the 
global scope and set it to 4."""
