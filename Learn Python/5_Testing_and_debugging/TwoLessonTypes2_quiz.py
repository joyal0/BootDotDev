"""Two Lesson Types
As we talked about, there are 2 types of coding lessons on Boot.dev:

	Console output lessons
	Unit-test lessons
Console output lessons

*Only 1 file of code, usually with a comment explaining where to write your code
*When you "submit" your code, its console output must match the expected output exactly to pass
*Debug print statements will cause your code to fail submission, so remove them before submitting

Unit-test lessons

*2 files of code: main and main_test. You can read the tests but you can't edit them
*When you "submit" your code, the return values of your functions must match the expected values exactly to pass
*Console output is ignored, you can leave debug print statements in your code
